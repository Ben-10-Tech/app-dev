## My favorite series

A Sign of Affection is a Japanese animation that premiered on January 6, 2024.
It is a story about a girl named Yuki who is deaf and a boy named Itsuomi who likes to travel around the world.
It is a heartwarming story that caught my eye.
Every character has their own life.
This is why A Sign of Affection became my favorite series, because I like RomCom.
