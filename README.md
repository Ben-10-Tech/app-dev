## My favorite series

A Sign of Affection is a Japanese animation that premiered on January 6, 2024.
It is a story about a female university student named Yuki who is deaf and a male university named Itsuomi who likes to travel around the world. 
At first Itsuomi speaks slowly when she is talking to Yuki, because Yuki can read lips.
Yuki gave Itsuomi a hand drawn sign language guide, that throughout the series Itsuomi learned sign language to talk with Yuki.
It is a heartwarming story that caught my eye.
Every character has their own story.
This is why A Sign of Affection became my favorite series, because I like RomCom.
